        <h2>These are some games designed...wait no, made by me, with a little help (only a bit)</h2>
        <p>Games use p5.js, p5.play and matter.js libraries in javascript ,theres a good chance you wont have any idea what that means but im leaving it cause it makes me sound smort</p>
        <p>to play these games click the image and it well take ypou to a different site where youll play the game
            <br> when yu hover your mouse on the images it gives an explanation on them
            <br> enjoy

        <p>this game is a remake of the google dino game.
        <br> just click on the image to get taken
        <br> to a seperate site, on this site youll play the game.
        <br>the reason it says p5 is because someone "published" 
        <br>it added the p5 logo and their name on the site.</p>

        <p>this is a self made ghost game.
            <br> basically use the space bar to jump 
            <br>and don't ram the windows.
            <br>don't ask 
        </p>

        <p>you know i love angry birds, so i remade angry birds!
             with pirates and cannons and a horrific "splash" sound 
            (don't shoot the water)
            i couldnt be bothered to fix it shut up. 
           <br>
            <br>i can already see the stories: angry pirates
        </p>

        <p>
            remember cut the rope? well i spoofed that to. 
           but its a bunny that gets melon. 
           i dont know so dont ask
           it has only one level, and the 
           most annoying song youll hear in any of these games 
           (except for the "splash" sound)
            this is more like showing you how the physics work,
           (in my games)
            as i can't just put a "game" where you make objects fly 
            around youll get this
            enjoy.

        <p>right click and open this link in a new tab.
            <br> because this ones multiplayer, 
            <br>for yourself. 
            <br>don't ask why i made a multiplayer game,
            <br> cause we both know that none of us have 
            <br>any friends to  play with...
            <br>and im not playing with you.
